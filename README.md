### Class Diagram Description  

**Main Activity:** In the main screen the user will be able to see current temperature/ weather condition, how it feels like,  the wind, humidity, description of the weather, cloudiness, pressure, and wind speed.    

**DataActivity:** In the main screen the user will be able to see details of the weather selected for any city in any country displaying current temperature/ weather condition, how it feels like,  the wind, humidity, description of the weather, cloudiness, pressure, and wind speed.  

**Volley:** Use Volley, which is an HTTP library that makes networking for Android apps easier and most importantly, faster.Volley excels at RPC-type operations used to populate a UI, such as fetching a page of search results as structured data. It integrates easily with any protocol and comes out of the box with support for raw strings, images, and JSON.  

**Json:** Use json object from the string response.  

**Weather:** The screen the user sees will display current temperature/ weather condition, how it feels like,  the wind, humidity, description of the weather, cloudiness, pressure, and wind speed.  

**IDAO:** Interface for weather data. Define a final string variable to store the url and define a final string variable to store the app id.
